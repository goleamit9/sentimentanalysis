## 📊 Professional Insights & Results

### 1. Dataset Overview
The dataset contains a total of **1,000 customer reviews** distributed across three sentiment categories:

| Sentiment | Count |
|-----------|-------|
| Positive  | 350   |
| Neutral   | 347   |
| Negative  | 303   |

**Observations:**
- Well-balanced dataset across three classes.
- Positive and Neutral reviews slightly outnumber Negative reviews.
- Balanced data ensures robust model learning without bias.

### 2. Model Performance
Evaluated on a **test set of 200 reviews**:

**Overall Accuracy:** 100%  

| Sentiment | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|-----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| Negative  | 1.00      | 1.00   | 1.00     | 61      |
| Neutral   | 1.00      | 1.00   | 1.00     | 69      |
| Positive  | 1.00      | 1.00   | 1.00     | 70      |

**Macro Avg:** 1.00  | **Weighted Avg:** 1.00  

**Observations:**
- Perfect classification on the test set.
- No misclassifications; reliable predictions.

### 3. Insights from Sentiment Distribution
- Positive Reviews (350): Generally satisfied customers.
- Neutral Reviews (347): Mixed or indifferent feedback.
- Negative Reviews (303): Areas for improvement.

**Actionable Insight:** Focus on analyzing Negative reviews to address recurring issues.



### 4. Recommendations
1. Monitor sentiment trends over time.
2. Deploy in real-time for new customer feedback.
3. Analyze Negative reviews to identify actionable improvements.
4. Expand dataset for more diverse reviews to improve model robustness.

**Conclusion:** The sentiment analysis model provides accurate insights into customer opinions, enabling data-driven decisions and improved customer satisfaction.

## 📌 Notes

- Ensure NLTK data is installed before running the GUI:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('omw-1.4')
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')
```
- Check file paths in `sentiment_gui.py`.
